Simple Line following robot

This design is based on a design at http://playwithrobots.com/make-it-form-scratch/simple-line-follower-robot
I have switched the sensor modules to use IR LEDs and IR Photodiodes instead of basic white LEDs.
Schematics capture was originally done in KiCad.   Rebuilt as v2 in diptrace.

Boards can be ordered from OshPark:
v1 board: http://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/IUjxxEeG
v2 main board:  http://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/y54Hc1CZ
v2 sensor board:  http://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/1NccGd6E

I will be developing a model for the chassis for the v1 electronics printable in a 3D printer.

I have ordered a set of v1 electronics from Oshpark.   Chassis design will start after the boards and parts arrive and are tested.
