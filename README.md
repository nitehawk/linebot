Simple Line following robot

This design is based on a design at http://playwithrobots.com/make-it-form-scratch/simple-line-follower-robot
I have switched the sensor modules to use IR LEDs and IR Photodiodes instead of basic white LEDs.
Schematics capture was originally done in KiCad.   Rebuilding as v2 in diptrace.

I will be developing a model for the chassis printable in a 3D printer.
